Space Shooter meets Math

This was created by me a while back when I realized that focusing on getting something done was much more important than doing it perfect.

Something I used to struggle with: Letting perfect get into the way of good enough. 

This game reflects this and was the project that helped me realize that it was better to have something now than something perfect down the line.
Before this I had many attempts of writing games but stopped before I got a project done, because I over-engineered things in order to get things done perfectly.
While writing this game I said to myself to explicitly not over-engineer things.
Because of that I was able to finish the game using the simplest concepts I could think of.

And I am to this day still happy with the results. Is the code pretty? Hell no. Can it be improved? Sure as hell. Does it bug me? Nope. It works just fine, just the code is a bit messy. But I have a working game ;)
