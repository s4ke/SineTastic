Space Shooter meets Math.

The original intent for this game was to produce a playable software without using any graphical assets.

Controls:

    Arrow Keys for Movement
    Space Bar for Shooting
    R for Restart/Revive 

Some interesting ideas that didn't make it into the game because the focus was to get something playable and not something perfect:

- Ability for the player to specify the shots the ships fire via a mathematical equation

- Ability for the player to enter a mathematical equation to specify the shape of the ship

- More complex enemy types that are defined by mathematical equations.

Therefore the current game might be considered a technical demo and not a full game.
